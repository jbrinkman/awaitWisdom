Recently, I've worked with a some teams that have approached a transformation to Agile practice as a checklist of items to complete. "In order to 'be Agile' we need to &lt;fill in the blank&gt;. Check. What's next?" They feel that the more Agile practices they can say they do, the more complete the transformation. This hasn't resulted in the transformation they wanted and they're looking for more items to check off.

Here's the thing: everyone likes a checklist. They're simple, easy to read, and satisfying to complete. The sense incremental progress and accomplishment they provide is great. In fact, if my wife has a rough day at work, she will generally describe it as an "added to the list kind of day." Conversely, a good day for her is a "checked a lot off the list kind of day."

We often use checklists as a roadmap for progress. Here are some pretty common search samples.
* [Steps to get out of debt](https://ddg.gg/?q=steps+to+get+out+of+debt)
* [Steps to get in shape](https://ddg.gg/?q=steps+to+get+in+shape)
* [Steps to buy a house](https://ddg.gg/?q=steps+to+buy+a+house)
* and even [Steps to be a better programmer](https://ddg.gg/?q=steps+to+be+a+better+programmer)

In addition to simple progressions, checklists can be great reminders. A brief bullet list doesn't contain enough information to learn something new, but it is a great way to jog your memory. For example, the [Web Developer Checklist](http://webdevchecklist.com/) provides a checklist of things to remember to do before launching a website. It offers very little instruction how to complete the items and no explanation of "why." Education isn't the point of the checklist; it assumes you know why and how. The point is just to remind you.

Of course there are other list types too. Not every bulleted set of words is a prescription or a progression. The list above is an example. Failing to discern that difference is like mistaking a menu for a recipe. The menu is a set of options, not a prescription. The intention of the list matters. We see a lot of "Best Practice" lists, which *are* intended to educate, but don't often include the lesson. They're really more like a Table of Contents or checklist of things to research. 

The problem is we sometimes misunderstand a list's intent, which is what I think has happened in this case. A list of "Agile Best Practices" is not a prescription for transformation, it is a tool list. The tools are not the goal, they help you get there. Each Agile practice is a remedy for a particular problem.

You don't "become Agile" by implementing all tools, especially if the purpose of those tools isn't understood. You
