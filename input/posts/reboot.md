#### Reboot MVP

I've wanted to resume blogging again for some time now, but there was something standing in my way: my current blog.

When I started blogging, I wanted to use my blog as an exercise to learn and flex programming muscles I hadn't been using much. To that end, I started by using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), which was fresh out of a successful Kickstarter. I wanted to see what all the hype surrounding Node.js was about, and the blog looked pretty sweet, so I decided to give it a shot. I made matters more complicated by hosting the blog in Azure, which was just starting to support Node.js at that time.

I enjoyed blogging, but I didn't enjoy all maintenance pains I encountered with my chosen setup. To make a long story shorter, it isn't a coincidence that I stopped blogging shortly after Ghost released 0.5.1. I had trouble applying the upgrade and lost interest. I wanted to write and instead created a chore.

After several half-hearted attempts to reboot, I've finally found the drive and the time to start building something new. I'm a slow learner, as I'm still using the blog as an opportunity to learn new things in addition to writing, but at least I'm learning, right?

I'm also using this chance to fight my own inclinations and instead practice what I preach by launching an imperfect, in progress blog. Rather than wait (probably forever) until I have a perfect site, I'll launch the bare minimum and iterate.  This post is the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). The style is still ugly and there is functionality missing, but if you're reading this then I've done enough to launch.

I think imperfect and improving is better than the dead blog it replaces. Check back for progress!
