[This](http://inamidst.com/stuff/notes/csspx) is  fascinating. Px is an angular measurement, convertible from radians. 
>The moon from earth is about 24.3px wide, for example. The Eiffel Tower from a mile away is about 550.5px tall. That means that when you do “{ width: 24.3px }” in CSS 2.1, you're making something as wide as the moon looks to be.

All these years of web slinging and I always thought it meant "pixels".
