It's that time of year again! With kids back in school and the Labor Day weekend approaching, summer is effectively over and the St. Louis Days of .NET (STLDODN) conference is approaching once again!

[Polaris Solutions](http://polarissolutions.com/) is once again a sponsor and several of us will be presenting.

[Angela Dugan](http://www.tfswhisperer.com) is back again this year with two talks: [Attaining Organizational Agility on a Shoestring](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/33) and [Structuring your Team Foundation Server for the Long Haul](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/34)

[Clint Edmonson](http://www.notsotrivial.net/blog/) will be back as well with two sessions: [Application Architecture Jumpstart](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/2) and [Advanced OOP - Laws, Principles, Idioms](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/1). I caught his OOP talk last year and it was great. Even experienced devs are guaranteed to learn something new or re-learn something they forgot.

[Jeff Przylucki](http://www.oneluckidev.com/) will make his STLDODN debut this year with a presentation on [TFS Team Project Consolidation and Migration](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/223).

And I have the honor of presenting two sessions again this year. I'll be talking about all the new ASP.NET Identity features in [Who are you? Digging into ASP.NET Identity](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/150). I'm also excited to present [Teaching the Cloud to Think](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions/151), which is an intro to machine learning and the new Azure Machine Learning offering.

Registration for STLDODN isn't open yet, but be sure to watch for it to open. The conference has sold out the last few years. Be sure to check out all the other [sessions](http://stldodn.com/2014/Sessions) and [precompilers](http://stldodn.com/2014/Precompilers). There's a lot of awesome content on the agenda!
