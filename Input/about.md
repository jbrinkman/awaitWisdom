In the C# programming language 'await' is a keyword used in asynchronous programming. It roughly means "if the task we're waiting on isn't complete, return to the caller so they can continue executing; we will finish processing when our task completes"

> Wis•dom (wĭzˈdəm) - n. The ability to discern or judge what is true, right, or lasting; insight. 

So, to me, "await wisdom" means I can't put things on hold and wait for wisdom to come to me. I have to continue along and hope to find some along the way. A bit of a stretch programmatically and admittedly nerdy, but that describes me too.

await Wisdom() is my place to share my experiences, both professional and personal. These experiences may be things I've learned, problems I'm facing, or even just rants. I hope you'll find something useful here.
