My name is Josh Gillespie. I live in St. Louis, Missouri with my wife and daughter.

I work as a Senior Consultant for [Polaris Solutions](http://polarissolutions.com), but **this blog, its content and opinions are my own**. I blog about whatever I'm learning about. That can include (but is not limited to) coding, technology, parenting, consulting, business, politics, finance, religion, and anything else I think might provoke thought or discussion.

In my free time, I like to travel, enjoy good food, exercise/[CrossFit](http://crossfitvalleypark.com), and occasionally attempting [obstacle course races with friends and colleagues](http://www.flickr.com/photos/voxdeix/sets/72157635603033066/).
